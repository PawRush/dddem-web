# Pipeline Deployment Plan: DDD East Midlands Website

Coding Agents should follow this Deployment Plan, and validate previous progress if picking up the Deployment in a new coding session.

**IMPORTANT**: Update this plan after EACH step completes. Mark the step `[x]` and update `last_updated` timestamp.

## Phase 1: Gather Context and Configure
- [x] Step 0: Inform User of Execution Flow
- [x] Step 1: Create Deployment Plan
- [x] Step 2: Detect Existing Infrastructure
  - [x] 2.1: Detect stacks and frontend
  - [x] 2.2: Detect app name and git repository
  - [x] 2.3: Determine quality checks
  - [x] 2.4: User confirmation
  - [x] 2.5: Use existing CodeConnection

**Phase 1 Checkpoint**

## Phase 2: Build and Deploy Pipeline
- [ ] Step 3: Create CDK Pipeline Stack
